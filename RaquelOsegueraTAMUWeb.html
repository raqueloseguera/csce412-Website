            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p> I'm a hardworking and outstanding college student currently majoring in Computer Science. I am seeking for an internship where I will be able to use my skills in a real world setting as well as gain workplace experience as a computer scientist. I think finding me the right internship for me can be beneficial in my work career, but I could benefit the company as well. One of my strong suits in this field is my communication. I am very good at communicating problems and keeping other involved in the loop. My CSCE 315 class has also allowed me to learn more about how teamwork takes place in a real-world setting. Teamwork is different when you’re in a group with all intelligent people, and y’all are all trying to solve one challenging goal. It gives us the opportunity to learn from our peers and get to know others thinking process. Which could be useful in the future. I believe my interest in this field is no coincidence.I come from a line of STEM people in my family. My mom is a Calculus and Statistics teacher, my dad is a chemical engineer, and my brother graduated in 2021 from UH in Computer Science. He is now working for Amazon as software engineer, that’s where my interest in computers started. I went to college thinking I was going to be a mechanical or architectural engineer. Taking engineering 102 I had come to realize quickly that I had enjoyed coding a lot. I knew from a young age I always wanted to do something in stem. I am a big math person. I am good with numbers and problem solving. I think what mostly attracts me to computer science and mathematics is that they both resemble a puzzle. In order to write a program or solve a mathematical equation their has to be problem solving involved. I have always loved puzzles since I was kid. </p>
